#### Text-input

A text input is simply a filed that follows after your question.
The solution is placed within a stylized input field.
In LiaScript quizzes are always associated with double brackets.

    [[Whatever you say boss]]

A matrix is basically a 2D representation multiple horizontal vectors.
The first row only defines the head of this quiz type.

    [ [head1] [ ;-) ] [ Option3 ] ]
    [   ( )     ( )       (X)     ]  <--
    [   [ ]     [X]       [X]     ]  <--
